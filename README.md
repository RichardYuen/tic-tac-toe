This project is a personal project which aim to build a AI-based Tictactoe HTML5 game using Phaser framework and Minimax algorithms.

## Phaser Framework

Phaser is a 2D game framework used for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile. It is free software developed by Photon Storm.

Phaser uses both a Canvas and WebGL renderer internally and can automatically swap between them based on browser support. This allows for fast rendering across desktop and mobile. It uses the Pixi.js library for rendering.

Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native desktop apps via 3rd party tools like Apache Cordova and phonegap.

Whilst you can wrap your game into a native app using tools such as Cordova and Phonegap the game itself is never compiled. The 'game' is simply run as JavaScript in a bundled browser. This means performance is nothing like a native compiled app.

## Minimax Algorithms

Minimax (sometimes MinMax, MM or saddle point) is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"â€”to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for n-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.
